# API Reference Guide

Welcome to the Daos Fun API! This guide will help you integrate with our platform to retrieve DAO information programmatically.

## Overview

The Daos Fun API provides access to detailed information about DAOs on our platform. Our API is designed to be simple to use and requires no authentication.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```bash
https://api-daos.fly.dev
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses will include the requested data, while error responses will include an error message and appropriate HTTP status code.

## Authentication

Currently, no authentication is required to access the API endpoints.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and optimal performance, we implement rate limiting on our API endpoints. Please implement appropriate caching strategies in your applications.

## Available Endpoints

### DAO Information

- [Get DAO by Mint](/api-reference/get-dao) - Retrieve detailed information about a specific DAO using its mint address

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

| Status Code | Description                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 200         | Success                            |
| 400         | Bad Request - Invalid parameters   |
| 404         | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| 500         | Internal Server Error              |

All error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": "Additional error details (if available)"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Implement proper error handling in your applications
2. Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API calls
3. Validate parameters before making requests
4. Monitor your API usage and implement rate limiting
