title: 'Party Round Tokens & Vesting'
---

Two quick definitions -- 

**Party Round Tokens** - Tokens that are received when a user commits to a Party Round. Eligible to interact with the vesting contract -- e.g. $CultureVEST

**DAO tokens** - Normal DAO tokens that have been vested, or released, from the vesting contract -- e.g. $CULTURE

All raises use Party Round tokens. 

## Customizing Your Party Round Tokens
When you start your raise, you will be asked to upload a name, image, and ticker for your Party Round token. 

If you are using vesting, we encourage you to use a "vest" theme. For example:
    - Ticker: $cultureVEST
    - Name: Culture Wif Vest
    - Image: Your logo wearing a vest

If you are not using vesting, we encourage you to use a "party" theme. For example:
    - Ticker: $culturePARTY
    - Name: Culture Party Round
    - Image: Your logo wearing a party hat

You will have four options for vesting: 
- "Fuck it" -- No vesting, immediate unlock
- Casual vesting -- 10% immediate unlock, 90% vested linearly every second over 3 months
- Intermediate vesting -- 10% immediate unlock, 90% vested linearly every second over 1 year
- Trump Mode -- 4 year cliff, followed by 100% unlock 


## Burning Party Round Tokens
When trading is opened, users can burn their Party Round tokens for the underlying DAO token. 

If you are not using vesting: 
- Users can burn all party tokens immediately when trading is opened. 
- Users receive their DAO tokens immediately upon burning. 

If you are using vesting: 
- Users can burn their vesting tokens immediately when trading is opened. 
- Users receive DAO tokens in proportion to the vesting schedule. 


## More Party Round Token Facts
- Once Party Round tokens are burned, only the address that burned them can claim DAO tokens. Please keep your wallets safe. 
- The Party Round tokens are transferable and can be made into liquidity pools on other sites. 
- DAO tokens are *different* from Party Round tokens:
    - They have unique CA's, images, tickers, and names. 
    - The native liquidity pool on Daos Fun is for the DAO token. 
    - The DAO token will ultimately serve as the redemption token for the DAO's assets. 
    - The DAO token will be used in governance when governance is enabled. 


## Nerd Zone
This example will illustrate the vesting mechanism. 

A DAO is using intermediate vesting -- 10% is claimable immediately, and 90% is vested over 1 year: 
1. A user burns 100% of his Party Round tokens immediately. 
    - He can claim 10% of the DAO tokens immediately. 
    - His DAO tokens continue to unlock every second, linearly over the year.
    - He can make additional claims at any time. 
2. A user waits six months before burning 100% of his Party Round tokens. 
    - He can claim 55% of the corresponding DAO tokens immediately. 
    - His remaining DAO tokens continue to unlock every second, linearly over the year.
    - He can make additional claims at any time. 
    - Explanation: The initial 10% DAO tokens are still claimable. 90% of DAO tokens are halfway through the linear vesting schedule. 10% initially claimable + 45% vesting supply = 55% claimable at 6 months. 
3. A user waits an entire year before burning 100% of his Party Round tokens. 
    - He can claim 100% of the corresponding DAO tokens immediately. 
    - Explanation: The entire 90% vesting supply is now claimable one year after vesting began.
