The funds in an investment DAO are meant to be used for investing in other on-chain assets.

### Investment DAO Lifecycle
1. A group of users pool money.
2. Users receive DAO tokens in return. 
3. The creator trades the pooled assets on chain. 
4. DAO tokens can be burned to redeem the fund's assets at expiration.
