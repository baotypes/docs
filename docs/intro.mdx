<Note>
  A DAO is a community with a mission and a treasury.
</Note>

<Note>
  The funds in an investment DAO can _only be used to buy other SPL tokens_. Any token available on the Jupiter API can be purchased.

<Note>
  This DAO structure was originally designed for groups of friends wanting to trade memecoins with each other.

### dao lifecycle

1. Users contribute funds to the DAO via a "[raise](https://docs.daos.fun/docs/example-raise)" or "party round."
2. Users receive [DAO tokens](https://docs.daos.fun/docs/liquidity) in return.
3. The creator trades the pooled assets (the [AUM](https://docs.daos.fun/docs/aum)) on-chain.
4. The DAO expires and the treasury (AUM) wallet is locked.
5. DAO tokens can be [burned to redeem](https://docs.daos.fun/docs/expiry-redemption) the DAO's assets.
