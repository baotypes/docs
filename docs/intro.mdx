<Note>
  A DAO is a community with a mission and a treasury. 
</Note>

<Note>
  The funds in an investment DAO can _only be used to buy other SPL tokens_. Any token available on the Jupiter API can be purchased.

<Note>
  This DAO structure was originally designed for groups of friends wanting to trade memecoins with each other.

### DAO Lifecycle

1. Users contribute funds to the DAO.
2. Users receive DAO tokens in return.
3. The creator trades the pooled assets on-chain.
4. The DAO expires and the treasury wallet is locked.
5. DAO tokens can be burned to redeem the DAO's assets.
