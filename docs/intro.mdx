<Note>
  This DAO structure was originally designed for groups of friends wanting to trade memecoins with each other. We called them Investment DAOs.
</Note>

<Note>
  The funds in an investment DAO are meant to be used for investing in other on-chain assets.
</Note>

<Note>
  We have expanded our definition of a DAO to include any community with a mission and a treasury, but the majority of DAOs launched on [daos.fun](http://daos.fun) are still Investment DAOs.

### DAO Lifecycle

1. Users contribute funds to the DAO.
2. Users receive DAO tokens in return.
3. The creator trades the pooled assets on-chain.
4. DAO tokens can be burned to redeem the fund's assets at expiration.
