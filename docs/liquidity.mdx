# Liquidity

Basic review from the example page. We should probably use this as a snippet. 

Each DAO has 1.1 billion DAO tokens. 
During the raise, one billion tokens are for sale. 
The extra 0.1 billion tokens are reserved to seed the initial liquidity pool on daos fun. 

A raise of 100 sol will actually raise 110 sol. 
The extra 10 percent of SOL is reserved with the 0.1 billion tokens to seed the initial liquidity pool on daos fun. 

Tokens are sold at a flat price. Everyone gets the same price when they commit to a raise. 
So in this example, 1b tokens are sold for 110 sol. 

Sol in fund: 100 sol
Tokens sold in raise: 1b
Liquidity pool: 10 sol, .1b tokens
