## Let's Track Tokens in a Raise

1. Each DAO has a supply of 1.1 billion DAO tokens.
    - During the raise, 1 billion DAO tokens are for sale.
        - Technically, 1 billion Party Round tokens are for sale, but they represent 1 billion DAO tokens.
    - The remaining 0.1 billion DAO tokens are reserved to seed the initial liquidity pool.
2. DAOs raise 10% extra in SOL during a raise.
    - For example, a target raise of 100 SOL will actually raise 110 SOL. 
3. The extra 10% SOL is paired with the 0.1 billion tokens to seed the liquidity pool.
    
#### In review, for a 100 SOL raise: 
- 100 SOL in the fund wallet
- 1b tokens sold for 110 SOL
- Liquidity pool contains: 10 SOL, 0.1b tokens 

## Basic Pool Party Facts
- We call our liquidity pools "Pool Parties".
- Daos Fun hosts the liquidity pool -- not Raydium. 
- The initial seeded liquidity is permanently locked. 
- Anyone with tokens and SOL can add liquidity to the pool.
    - This includes the DAO wallet. 

## For The Creator
- All Pool Parties have a ticker, image, and name. 
    - Please craft a pool-themed concept
    - For example, NuDAO, a desci DAO, has named theirs $WETLAB 
- Sniping the pool
    - Some of our launches have been sniped. The liquidity pool address is public, so it is possible to snipe the pool.
    - We have a good relationship with a benevolent counter-sniper, who can help us defend against snipers. 
    - Please ask to get in touch with him, while we figure out a better solution. 

## More Pool Party Facts
- We use auto-compounding Uniswap v2 style pools. 
- We use Token 2022 token standard for our DAO tokens.  
- DexScreener, Photon, BullX, and others do not index our pools.
    - Our pools are not visible on these platforms.
    - If you want your tokens to be visible on these platforms, you will need to create a liquidity pool on Raydium or Meteora.
    - It is possible to create a liquidity pool on Raydium with the DAO wallet.
- Gecko Terminal and Azura do index our pools.


## Taxes and Fees
- All transactions through Daos Fun pools are taxed at 1.5%. 
- 0.5% of all transactions go to you, the creator. 
- 0.5% of all transactions go to Daos Fun. 
- 0.5% of all transactions auto-compounds into the pool.
