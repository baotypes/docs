### **How to Manage Invite Links**

- The “Manage” tab is where creators can create links, manage the whitelist, and set VIP status. 
- The “Create Link” button will allow you to create an invite link for your raise. 
  - Here you can set the allocation and name the link.
  - We recommend you use the naming feature to stay organized.
- Clicking on the blurred out blue text next to the link name will copy it so you can share it.
- Next to the link you will see some icons: 
  - **Silhouette with minus sign**: this removes VIP status for everyone who has signed this link.
  - **Star**: this gives VIP status to everyone who has signed this link.
  - **Checkmark**: this approves everyone who has signed this link.
  - **X**: this unapproves everyone who has signed this link and puts their status as “pending.”
  - Clicking these icons will only change status for people who have already signed the link. 
    - Example: If you give Daniel a link and he signs it, then you approve the link and mark it as VIP, Daniel will be approved as a VIP. If Roy signs the link _after_ this, he won’t be approved or marked as VIP until you click the icons again. 
  - **Pencil**: this allows you to rename the link and change the allocation.
- You can also manage approvals and VIPs individually when you click “participants.” 
  - This is sometimes necessary in the event that a link gets leaked to people you don’t want to participate.
  - This also filters by pending, approved, and ignored & revoke.
- You can enable and disable a link at any time using the toggle under “enabled.” 
  - This is sometimes necessary when links get leaked.

## **Managing NFT Whitelists**

- To whitelist an NFT collection, click “Create NFT Party.”
- You will need the Collection Address.
- Once you click “Continue to Sol Allocation,” the WL will be created and a holder snapshot will be taken.
  - There is a bug currently where you need to click “x” to continue the process. We are working on it. 
- You can edit the allocation by clicking on the pencil.
  - Here you can determine how much Sol is allocated per NFT.
- Participants whitelisted via a NFT collection will automatically be added to the Public Commit phase.

## **Managing SPL Whitelists**

- To whitelist SPL token holders, click “Create SPL Whitelist.”
- You can search for the token by name or contract address. 
  - We recommend searching by CA to ensure you WL the correct token.
- You will need to determine a max sol amount allocated to holders of this token. 
  - Their individual allocation scales with the number of tokens they hold.
- Once you click “Take Snapshot,” a snapshot will be taken and the WL will be created.
- You will need to click “Manage” to start the check-in. 
  - Users need to check in if they would like to participate. 
- You will then need to click “Manage” again to open commitments. 
  - Users can only commit if they checked in during the check-in phase.
- Participants whitelisted via a SPL token will automatically be added to the Public Commit phase.
