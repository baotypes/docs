Let us consider an example raise of 100 sol. A friend group of meme coin traders has received an invite code to launch on Dao's Fund. 
they have a max raise attached to their invite code in a twitter account attached to their invite code they list on the site fill out the details 
-They are now publicly visible on the site. 

When the manager is ready, he can start the raise. Starting the raise Starts your one week Timer to complete a raise This timer is enforced on chain 

Raises have a hard cap. 
When the max raise is met, the raise curve locks. 
If the max raise is not met, then all users can redeem their funds without a fee

Each DAO has 1.1 billion DAO tokens. 
During the raise, one billion tokens are for sale. 
The extra 0.1 billion tokens are reserved to seed the initial liquidity pool on daos fun. 

A raise of 100 sol will actually raise 110 sol. 
The extra 10 percent of SOL is reserved with the 0.1 billion tokens to seed the initial liquidity pool on daos fun. 

Tokens are sold at a flat price. Everyone gets the same price when they commit to a raise. 
So in this example, 1b tokens are sold for 110 sol. 

Sol in fund: 100 sol
Tokens sold in raise: 1b
Liquidity pool: 10 sol, .1b tokens


Users receive their dao tokens immediately upon committing to the raise. 
Users own their tokens and can send them or make liquidity pools with them on other sites -- even before the daos fun liquidity pool is live. 

Let's say our example fund just filled with 110 sol. The onchain timer stops.

Next, the manager signs a transaction that: 
- Moves the 100 sol from the fundraising contract to the fund's wallet
- Enables the liquidity pool by moving 10 sol and .1b tokens
- Allows traders to begin trading on daos fun

Trading is live for the token and for the manager
