It is important to understand the Redemption Process because this is what every Dao is building towards. 
It is our hope to ship governance that will allow voting to extend the expiration date of DAOs. 
I imagine it will be best for many DAOs to vote to extend their fund if things are going well, instead of going to redemption. 


<Note>
The Dao Token is a redemption token. 
</Note>

There is a timer attached to the Smart Wallet. 
This is the amount of time that you selected combined with the date that you listed the fund on Dao's fund website. 
When the timer fills no more transactions can be executed from the wallet. 

Please pay special attention to this date. 
Consider making a calendar event because you will want to have your fund in order before your wallet expires. 


You can close the fund at any time prematurely. You do this by pressing the convert and close button. 

in order for you to receive your carry you need to convert and close convert your fund into wrapped sol and convert your tokens into wrapped sol

Both soul and wrapped soul can be redeemed out of a Dao. 

When the fund expires, a snapshot is taken of the assets in the fund. 
This means that tokens sent to the fund after it expires will not be able to be redeemed because redemption is based on the snapshot at close. 

Even after a fund is expired the DAO token can trade indefinitely. Remember this is a normal token 2022 token on the Solana network it just has unique capabilities with one smart contract. 


# Redemption

At the moment only sol is redeemed. 

All other tokens are stuck in there. 

The concept like a normal fund at the moment is to sell all of the other tokens into Sol similar how someone would sell Give dollars they would manage it in various positions then sell dollars to redeem at the end of the fund 

it is possible in the future we will be able to ship burn to redeem multiple types of tokens 

burn pro rata so one percent of the supply burns to redeem one percent of the sol 




This is why increasing the AUM is of particular importance.
