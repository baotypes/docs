## expiration

- All DAOs have a set, on-chain expiration date which is displayed on their [daos.fun](http://daos.fun) page -- you can select the desired length of a DAO during DAO creation.
- Eventually, governance will be introduced to **allow voting to extend the expiration date** of a DAO.
- When a DAO expires, **no more transactions** can be executed from the [daos.fun](http://daos.fun) treasury wallet. The DAO funds will be locked.
- The **DAO token will continue to trade** freely on Meteora.
- **Set a calendar reminder** for this date to ensure your fund is ready before expiry.

## closing the fund early

- Currently, DAOs cannot be closed early.

## dao token = redemption token

- DAO tokens are **redemption tokens** — when a DAO is expired, they can be burned to redeem treasury assets once a DAO expires.
- All SPL tokens in the DAO can be redeemed prorata.
  - E.g. if you own 1% of the DAO tokens, you can redeem 1% of the SOL, WIF, POPCAT, etc in the DAO.
  - There is one exception -- the DAO's own DAO token cannot be redeemed. E.g. I cannot redeem \$GFC by burning \$GFC -- even if it is present in the DAO.

## redemption nuances

- When the fund expires:
  - A **snapshot** is taken of the AUM's assets.
  - **Only assets present in the AUM at the time of the snapshot** are eligible for redemption.
  - Tokens sent **after expiration** are not redeemable.
- Best practice is to **sell non-SOL tokens into SOL** before fund expiry.
  - Similar to how a fund manager would liquidate assets before closing. This ensures that a Creator will be able to receive their Carry %.

## creator carry %

- The carry is a percentage of DAO profits that the creator gets to keep.
- The creator gets the carry on the _profit_ that they generate in the DAO.
- E.g. If the DAO starts with 100 SOL, and ends with 150 SOL, the prift is 50 SOL. If the creator carry is 20%, then they get 10 SOL as the carry (20% of 50 SOL is 10 SOL).
