### Understanding the Redemption Process

- The **redemption process** is what every DAO is ultimately building toward.
- Governance will be introduced to **allow voting to extend the expiration date** of a DAO.
  - Many DAOs may choose to extend the fund instead of redeeming if performance is strong.

### DAO Token = Redemption Token

- DAO tokens are **redemption tokens** — they can be burned to redeem treasury assets.
- A **timer** is attached to the Smart Wallet.
  - This timer is based on the **duration selected \+ listing date** on the [DAOs.FUN](http://DAOs.FUN) site.
  - Once the timer expires, **no more transactions** can be executed from the wallet.
  - **Set a calendar reminder** for this date to ensure your fund is ready before expiry.

### Closing the Fund

- A fund can be **closed early at any time** by clicking **“Convert and Close.”**
- To receive carry:
  - You must **convert the fund** into **wrapped SOL (wSOL)**.
  - You must **convert DAO tokens** into **wrapped SOL**.

### Post-Expiration Rules

- When the fund expires:
  - A **snapshot** is taken of the wallet’s assets.
  - **Only assets present at the time of the snapshot** are eligible for redemption.
  - Tokens sent **after expiration** are not redeemable.
- Even after expiration:
  - The DAO token can **still be traded**.
  - It behaves like a **normal SPL token** with special smart contract functionality.

### Redemption Mechanics (Current State)

- **Only SOL is redeemable** at this time.
- All other tokens are currently **stuck in the wallet**.
- Best practice is to **sell non-SOL tokens into SOL** before fund expiry.
  - Similar to how a fund manager would liquidate assets before closing.

### Future Redemption Features (Planned)

- DAO may support **burn-to-redeem multiple token types** in the future.
- Redemption may shift to a **pro-rata burn model**:
  - Example: Burning 1% of the supply unlocks 1% of the SOL in the treasury.

### Why AUM Matters

- Increasing the **Assets Under Management (AUM)** grows the value that can be redeemed.
- Stronger AUM = more SOL (or other tokens) available at redemption.
