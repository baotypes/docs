## Before Raising
- An excellent investment DAO candidate has spoken with the Daos Fun team. 
- He has received an invite code to launch on Daos Fun. 
- His invite code has a raise amount and a Twitter account attached to it. 
- He inputs his code into the site and fills out his DAO's details. 

## Listed On Daos Fun
- His DAO is now publicly visible on Daos Fun.
- He can promote his DAO and craft his whitelist, but cannot yet accept SOL.  

## The Raise Process
- When the manager is ready, he can start the raise. 
- His raise has a 7-day deadline to complete. 
- He will use the Daos Fun whitelisting features to accept allocations and fill his fund. 

## The Raise Fills
- The onchain timer stops as soon as the fund is filled. 
- The manager can sign a transaction at his convenience that:
  - Moves the SOL from the fundraising contract to the Investment DAO's wallet.
  - Enables the liquidity pool for DAO tokens on Daos Fun.
  - Allows traders to interact with the vesting contract on Daos Fun. 
- Trading is now live for DAO token traders and for the manager.

## Additional Raise Facts
- Tokens are sold at a flat price. Everyone gets the same price when they commit to a raise.
- All tokens must be sold -- tokens cannot be airdropped or reserved. 
- Raises have a hard cap that cannot be exceeded.
- If the raise goal is not met in 7 days, the raise fails. 
  - All users can withdraw their SOL without a fee. 
- Users receive unvested tokens immediately upon committing to the raise. 
- Users own their tokens. They can transfer their tokens or make liquidity pools on other sites -- even before the Daos Fun liquidity pool is live.
