title: "The Raise"
description: "This page describes the raise process for a "invite-only" DAO. We also offer bonding curve raises, but those are more straightforward. "

## Before Raising

- Excellent DAO managers have often spoken with the [daos.fun](http://daos.fun) team, we are glad to assist throughout. 
- They have clicked "start DAO" on [daos.fun](http://daos.fun) and have applied to start a DAO on daos.fun.
- They have determined what their mission is (this could just be an investment strategy or a focus on a particular ecosystem or niche).
- They are using a solid image and ticker (the best ones are meme-able).
- They have selected a reasonable raise amount -- many DAOs have had success in the 150-250 sol raise range. Be aware that DAO creators must commit 10% of the raise. 

## Approval for Raising on daos.fun

- Once they apply, their DAO is now publicly visible on daos.fun, but it's not yet possible to interact with the DAO -- this requires approval from the [daos.fun](http://daos.fun) team.
- We approve DAOs that have a strong and viable bull case. 
- Once approved, creators can start crafting their whitelist.

## The Raise Process

High-level overview. 

- When the creator is ready, they can start the raise by clicking “Start Raise.” This action starts a 7 day timer to complete the raise. 
- There are 3 phases to a raise: VIP Commit, Regular Commit, and Public.
  - When creators click “Start Raise,” they will need to commit their sol for 10% of the raise.
    - Example: If the raise is 100 sol, the creator must contribute 10 sol. 
    - The VIP round will start immediately.
  - VIP Commit: Party Round participants with “VIP” status get a protected commitment phase. 
    - VIPs should be the strongest supporters of the DAO, diamond handed, and ready to contribute to the DAO.
  - Regular Commit: People who have signed an invite link but not been marked as VIP -- or people who are whitelisted via NFT or SPL tokens.
    - Creators should overallocate this phase.
    - The raise should be filled during this phase. 
  - Public Commit: This is for anyone to contribute as much as they want to the raise.
    - We advise people not to use this phase unless absolutely necessary.
- Users receive their tokens immediately upon committing to the DAO. 
- The raise has a 7-day deadline to complete. If the raise does not fill after 7 days, then everyone can burn their tokens and redeem their original SOL without penalty. 
- Creators will use the Daos Fun whitelisting features to accept allocations and fill the fund.
  - DAO creators can also whitelist NFT collections and SPL tokens on Solana.

## The Raise Fills

- The on-chain timer stops as soon as the fund is filled.
- By clicking “Start Trading” the creator can sign a transaction at his convenience that:
  - Moves the SOL from the fundraising contract to the DAO’s wallet (AUM).
  - Deploys the liquidity pool for DAO tokens using Meteora’s DAMM V2 LP.
- Trading is now live for DAO token traders and for the creator.

## Additional Raise Facts

- [daos.fun](http://daos.fun) uses a presale mechanism, not a bonding curve. Everyone gets the same price when they commit to a raise.
- All tokens must be sold — tokens cannot be airdropped or reserved.
- Raises have a hard cap that cannot be exceeded.
- If the raise goal is not met in 7 days, the raise fails.
  - All users can withdraw their SOL without a fee.
- Users receive tokens immediately upon committing to the raise.
- Users own their tokens. They can transfer their tokens or make liquidity pools on other sites — even before the official liquidity pool is live.
