The DAOs Fund Wallet is a browser extension which can be downloaded here. 

The best places to trade are on Dao's fun jupe.ag jup perps and raydium 


The DAO Wallet does not allow sending of tokens easily. 
If you would like to send Sol out of your DAO, please get in touch with the DAO's fun team. 
Currently it is not possible to send anything other than SOL out of the DAO Wallet. 



The DAO's fund wallet is a fork of the Squad's Protocol multi-signature wallet. 
Each fund can have up to three delegate signers. 
You can manage your delegate signers out of the admin panel. 
For a detailed explanation of how to do this click here. 
You will be using a DAO wallet address to sign on behalf of a fund which has a separate wallet address 
(It is this design mechanism that prohibits the use of Solana apps that require a signature. )
Examples are Pumpfun, Kamino, Drift, and degen coin flip
This also means you can't directly participate in other DAOs party rounds on DAOs Fund from the DAO Wallet because signing a transaction is required to reserve an allocation. 
We have a workaround available. Please get in touch with the DAOs Fund team. 

it is also this design mechanism that sometimes causes errors that instructions are to large.
There is a handful of logic in building a transaction that has to do with signing details. 
So this takes up instruction space and creates some transactions to be too large on some complicated transactions. 



Unlike most multi-sig wallets, each signature is a full signature to execute a transaction. There is no two of three threshold, or three of three threshold, to execute. 
Please be aware that each of these wallets have their own address and need a little bit of Sol as gas to sign transactions 
These wallets are not compatible with Ledger. 
These addresses do not have public keys. They are PDAs, or something derived accounts. 
you will create a password on your browser to protect your access to the wallet 
if you lose the wallet you can regenerate another one from the admin panel without a problem
