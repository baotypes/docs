### Hedgie Mode

#### DAO Wallet Overview

- The [**DAOs.FUN**](http://DAOs.FUN)** Wallet** is a **browser extension** that can be downloaded [here].
- Best platforms for trading with the DAO Wallet:
  - [**daos.fun**](http://daos.fun)
  - [**jupe.ag**](http://jupe.ag)
  - **Jupiter perps**
  - **Raydium**

#### Token Transfers & Limitations

- **DAO Wallet does not allow easy token transfers**.
  - If you need to send **SOL out of your DAO**, contact the [DAOs.FUN](http://DAOs.FUN) team.
  - Currently, **only SOL** can be sent from the DAO Wallet.

#### Wallet Architecture & Delegates

- The DAO Wallet is a **fork of the Squads Protocol multisig wallet**.
- Each fund can have up to **3 delegate signers**.
  - Delegates are managed via the **admin panel**.
  - [Click here] for a detailed guide on managing delegates.
- The DAO wallet **signs on behalf of a separate fund address**.
  - This design **prevents use of apps that require signature-based actions**, like:
    - [**Pump.fun**](http://Pump.fun)
    - **Kamino**
    - **Drift**
    - **Degen Coin Flip**
    - [**DAOs.FUN**](http://DAOs.FUN)** party rounds** (allocations can't be reserved from DAO Wallet)

#### Signing Limitations & Errors

- Signing architecture can cause **"instruction too large"** errors.
  - Signature logic adds instruction overhead, occasionally exceeding transaction size limits.
- **No multisig thresholds** (e.g., 2-of-3):
  - Each signature **executes the transaction** independently.

#### Technical Details

- Each wallet:
  - Has its own **address** (requires **some SOL** for gas).
  - Is **not compatible with Ledger**.
  - Is a **PDA (program-derived address)** â€” not a traditional public key wallet.
- Wallet access is protected by a **browser password**.
  - If lost, it can be **regenerated from the admin panel**.

#### Automation & Trading

- Wallet supports **automated transactions**.
- Refer to the most **up-to-date transaction guide** [here].
