## troubleshooting

- does your signing wallet have gas? keep a small amount of gas in the linked wallet
- do you have the correct wallet connected to daos.fun?
- are you using phantom? works the best
- are you using a reasonable slippage?
- have you tried splitting a larger transaction into multiple smaller transactions? removing decimal places or using smaller size can help.

## additional facts

- we only support trading spl tokens thru the jupiter API-- currently no nfts, perps, defi, or bridging is supported
- all daos spawn only being able to trade jupiter-verified tokens -- you can make a proposal in governance to allow you to trade unverified jupiter SPL tokens.
- you can't withdraw tokens directly from the aum
- you can have up to 3 signers linked to the day -- be aware that each wallet is a full signer and can execute transactions
- the trading experience is good but is not optimized for high-frequency or time-sensitive trading patterns. we suggest avoiding these strategies.
