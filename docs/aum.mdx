### aum concept

- A core concept of [DAOs.FUN](http://DAOs.FUN) is **AUM** — Assets Under Management.
- AUM is displayed on **your DAO’s homepage**.
- Each DAO has a **designated Smart Wallet** where fund assets are stored.
- On [DAOs.FUN](http://DAOs.FUN), all wallet assets are shown on your DAO page.

### net asset value (nav)

- The **NAV (Net Asset Value)** is the **total sum of all assets under management**.
- NAV is a key metric that users consider when **investing in DAOs**.
- Wallet activities and holdings are **public and transparent** for anyone to inspect.

### Transparency Best Practices

- **Do not bridge assets off-chain** or withdraw to other Solana addresses.
- While technically allowed, **withdrawing funds**:
  - Requires intense communication and trust.
  - Often **reduces trust and interest** from potential investors.
  - Can cause people to **dismiss your DAO without further research** due to a lower visible AUM.

### Asset Display Order

- SOL and Wrapped SOL balances are always shown **first**.
- All other asset positions are **listed in descending order** by market value.

### Illiquid or "Grayed-Out" Assets

- Assets with **insufficient liquidity** are grayed out.
- A **simple price impact test** is performed to determine liquidity viability.
- This system prevents **AUM bugs caused by tokens with inflated valuations** in low-liquidity pools.

### Excluded Assets

- The following are **not currently included** in AUM calculations:
  - [DAOs.FUN](http://DAOs.FUN) liquidity pool tokens (e.g., Raydium LPs)
  - NFTs
  - Assets held in other wallets
  - Assets on other chains

### Why AUM Matters

- DAO token holders care about AUM because it reflects **redemption value**.
- A higher AUM = more perceived value and credibility for your DAO.
