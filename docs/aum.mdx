### aum concept

- A core concept of [DAOs.FUN](http://DAOs.FUN) is **AUM** — Assets Under Management.
- AUM is displayed on **your DAO’s homepage**.
- Each DAO has a **wallet **where fund assets are stored.
- On [DAOs.FUN](http://DAOs.FUN), all wallet assets are shown on your DAO page.
- Anyone can send assets to this wallet, and the wallet's activity can be inspected on Solscan by clicking "Activity".

### net asset value (nav)

- The **NAV (Net Asset Value)** is the **total sum of all assets under management**.
- NAV is a key metric that users consider when **investing in DAOs**.
- Wallet activities and holdings are **public and transparent** for anyone to inspect.

### display of assets

- SOL and Wrapped SOL balances are always shown **first**.
- All other asset positions are **listed in descending order** by market value.
- Assets with **insufficient liquidity are grayed out**. This system prevents AUM bugs caused by tokens with inflated valuations in low-liquidity pools.
- The following are **not currently included** in AUM calculations:
  - Liquidity pool tokens (e.g. Raydium LPs)
  - NFTs
  - Assets held in other wallets
  - Assets on other chains
- Sometimes our spam assets will be included in the AUM and legitimate assets will not be included -- if this happens, please alert us, so we can fix it. 

### why aum matters

- DAO token holders care about AUM because it reflects **redemption value**.
- A higher AUM = more perceived value and credibility for your DAO.
