# AUM Concept


So a core concept of Dows Fund is the AUM, the Assets Under Management. 

The AUM displays on your DAO home page. 

Each DAO has a designated Smart Wallet Where are the funds assets are stored.

On daos.fun we display all of the assets in a wallet on your DAO page. 

The sum total of all of the assets under management is referred to as the NAV, or the net asset value. 
The net asset value is one of the core things that DAOs Fund users pay attention to when investing in DAOs. 
Your wallet, your wallet activities, and your holdings are public and available for everyone to inspect! 

For this reason, we greatly discourage bridging off-chain, withdrawing funds to other Solana addresses, 
There are limited examples where DAOs have done this and the market has received this well. 
This creates a scenario where people totally trust the creator to return the funds before redemption. 
It is possible to do this, to withdraw, and remain in good standing. But it is very difficult and requires an immense communication burden. 
And it will limit your reach as a DAO manager because some people will see a lower AUM and not be interested just off of that. 
They won't even research into your Dao or your management practice. 

We always list Sol and Wrapped Sol first and display your balances there. 
Then we list your positions by market value. Descending. 

Grade-out assets are coins that do not have adequate liquidity. 
We perform a simple price impact test to determine if there is enough liquidity in a coin for it to be considered a legitimate asset. 
This was designed because assets with huge valuations in tiny liquidity pools were causing AUM bugs on our site. 


Currently, we do not display in the value of Daos Fun Liquidity Pools Raydiumliquidity pools or NFTs. 

Additionally, we do not currently offer support for indexing assets in other wallets or on other chains. 

DAO token holders often care about the AUM because it shows that there is a redemption value to the fund.
