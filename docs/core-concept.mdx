### Fund Lifecycle
1. A group of people pool money and the fund manager trades it on chain. 
2. People who give to the fund receive DAO tokens in return. 
3. DAO tokens can be burned to redeem the fund at expiration. 



### Basic Definitions

DAO Token: A tradable asset that represents a share of the fund. 

Expiration: The date when the fund will be closed and the wallet will be frozen. 

Redemption: The process of burning DAO tokens to redeem a percentage of SOL in the fund. 

Carry: The fee percentage that the creator takes on the SOL **profit**.

Creator: The person who created the fund. 

Pool Party: Liquidity pool that we host on Daos Fun.

Assets Under Management (AUM): The list of assets in the fund.

Net Asset Value (NAV): The total market value of assets in the fund.

DAO Wallet: The address that holds SOL and other assets for the fund.

Party Round: Our native whitelisting feature with two tiers -- VIP and General Party Round. 

Admin Panel: This is the view you get of your DAO page when you are logged in with the creator wallet and the creator twitter account.
