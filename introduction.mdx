# Creator Onboarding Guide

Welcome to Daos Fun! This guide will walk you through the process of creating and managing your fund. We're glad you're here!

## Getting Started

1. Locate your invite code and maximum raise amount at the top of this page

2. Visit the Daos Fun site with at least 0.2 SOL in your wallet

3. Create your fund by setting up:

   * Ticker symbol

   * Fund name

   * Description

   * Fund image

Note: The initialization transaction may occasionally fail. If this happens, please try again.

## Creating Your Party Round

The party round is where you'll define the initial distribution of your fund. This is a crucial phase that requires careful attention.

### Setting Up Links

1. Create invitation links for potential investors

   * If link creation fails, go to Investor Relations and reconnect your Twitter account

   * Set custom allocation amounts for each link

   * Create a "public" link for general access

   * Set up special links with higher allocations for specific investors

   * Create VIP links for priority access

### Managing Requests

* Review and approve/deny individual investment requests

* Use bulk actions to "approve all" or "deny all" requests

* Monitor your fund's distribution carefully

> **Important:** Most creators aim to sell out during the party round to avoid bot activity during public minting.

### Before Proceeding to Mint

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Steps:**

1. Pause all invitation links

2. Triple-check all allocations

3. Verify VIP list accuracy

**Note:** Once you start the VIP Round, you cannot modify either the VIP list or the party round list.
